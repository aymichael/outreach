      title: "Workshop on Algebra",
      subtitle: "Groups and Symmetries",
      dates: ["5 Aug 2024", "7 Aug 2024"],
      time: "09:30 - 12:30",
      speakers: ["Prof. Michael McBreen"],
      abstract: "This workshop explores the world of groups and symmetries. We will start with some basic questions: what are the symmetries of a human face? A tea cup? A sphere? We will see how symmetry can be used to solve seemingly complex problems in beautifully simple ways, and get to know some of the weirder groups of symmetries in two and three dimensions. We will examine attempts to classify symmetry groups. We will try and understand both the successes and the failures of this approach, and finally we will glimpse some of the enduring mysteries of the subject.",

      abstract: "Game theory, a captivating branch of mathematics, offers a unique perspective on strategic decision-making, with applications spanning diverse fields such as economics, politics, biology, and psychology. In this workshop, students will have the opportunity to delve into the fundamental concepts of game theory and explore how these principles can be applied to real-world challenges. Through interactive games and engaging discussions, students will gain valuable insights into strategic thinking and problem-solving.",

This will culminate in an exploration in the counter-intuitive ideas about cardinality and infinity first discovered by Georg Cantor, which changed the landscape of the mathematical world forever. Prepare to be enlightened and inspired by the depth and elegance of these fundamental mathematical concepts.",
